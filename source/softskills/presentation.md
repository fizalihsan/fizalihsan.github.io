# Excerpts from book: Presentation Zen

* Creative
* **Pecha Kucha** (means chatter) - 20 slides in 20 seconds per slide - Total 6 min 40 secs - if you can’t tell the essence of your story in less than seven minutes, then you probably shouldn't be presenting anyway.
* Planning - jot down ideas on a piece of paper first
* Fundamentals questions to answer during planning stage
  * How much time do I have?
  * What’s the venue like?
  * What time of the day will I be speaking?
  * Who is the audience?
  * What is their background?
  * What do they expect of me?
  * Why was I asked to speak?
  * What do I want them to do?
  * What visual medium is most appropriate for this particular situation and audience?
  * What is the fundamental purpose of my talk?
  * What’s the story here?
  * And this is the most fundamental question of all, stripped down to its essence: What is the core point?
* Summarizing all the above, bottom line questions to answer are What is your point? Why does it matter?
* No more than 6 or 7 words per slide


# Excerpts from book: Speaking Powerpoint

* 3 steps to prepare a presentation
  1. Prepare story board - before even opening the powerpoint, answer the following first
    * What information the reader needs?
    * In what order my slides will be shown?
    * What evidence do I need to support?
  * Prepare slides. After step 1, each slide has a single message that supports the overall argument.
  * Design the slides: Understand what needs to be highlighted in the slides.
