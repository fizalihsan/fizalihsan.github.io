# Charts

## Pie chart
* Used to visualize proportions
* Never use percentage as proportions

## Bar chart
* Prefer horizontal bar chart when the category names are longer.
* Segmented bar chart is used to show both frequency and percentage.

## Histogram
* Histogram's bar area must be proportional to frequency.
* Frequency Density = Frequency / Group Width

> What is the difference between Histogram & Bar chart?
> * Widths are constant in bar charts. It varies in histogram.
> * No gaps between bars in histogram.

## Line Chart
* Use only for numerical data. Never for categorical data.

> Rule: When using percentages in charts, show frequency also. 

## What type of chart to use?
| To show        | use           |
| -------------        |:-------------:|
| Category + Frequency | Pie chart | 
| Category + Percentage | Bar chart   |
| Category + Frequency + Percentage | Segmented Bar      |
| Range of numbers + Frequency | Histogram |
| Range of numbers + Cumulative Frequency | Line chart |  

# Averages

## Mean 
* **Outliers** - An extreme high or low value that stands out from the rest of the data.
* **Skewed Data** - When outliers pull the data to the left or right.

## Median
* Sort and find the middle value. 
* Use this when the data is skewed.
* Can fluctuate if the data is symmetrical.

## Mode
* Most frequent value. There can be more than one mode in a data set. 
* Bimodal - data set with 2 modes
* Group / category with highest frequency is *modal class*
* When to use?
  * When the data is categorical
  * For the data with clusters
* When not to use?
  * When there are many modes.
