# Benefits & Risks

* **Benefits**
	* Cost effective
	* No software installation required
	* High efficiency, reliability & flexibility
	* On-demand self-service
	* Online development & deployment
* **Risks**
	* *Security & Privacy* - any security breach may compromise sensitive customer data
	* *Lock-In* - difficult for clients to switch from one Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to another
	* *Isolation Failure* - failure of isolation mechanism that separates storage, memory, and routing between the different tenants.
	* ** -
# Deployment Models

* **Public Cloud**
	* The public cloud allows systems and services to be easily accessible to the general public. Public cloud may be less secure because of its openness.
* **Private Cloud**
	* The private cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an organization. It is more secured because of its private nature.
* **Community Cloud**
	* The community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations.
* **Hybrid Cloud**
	* The hybrid cloud is a mixture of public and private cloud, in which the critical activities are performed using private cloud while the non-critical activities are performed using public cloud.

# Service Models

{% img right /technology/cloud-computing-service-models.jpg %}

* **Infrastructure-asâ€“a-Service (IaaS)**
	* IaaS is the most basic level of service. Each of the service models inherit the security and management mechanism from the underlying model, as shown in the following diagram
	* IaaS provides access to fundamental resources such as physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, etc.
* **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**
	* PaaS provides the runtime environment for applications, development and deployment tools, etc.
* **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**
	* SaaS model allows to use software applications as a service to end-users.
* **Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS)** is yet another service model, which includes *Network-as-a-Service*, *Business-as-a-Service*, *Identity-as-a-Service*, *Database-as-a-Service* or *Strategy-as-a-Service*.

# Characteristics

* **On Demand Self Service**
	* Cloud Computing allows the users to use web services and resources on demand. One can logon to a website at any time and use them.
* **Broad Network Access**
	* Since cloud computing is completely web based, it can be accessed from anywhere and at any time.
* **Resource Pooling**
	* Cloud computing allows multiple tenants to share a pool of resources. One can share single physical instance of hardware, database and basic infrastructure.
* **Rapid Elasticity**
	* It is very easy to scale the resources vertically or horizontally at any time. Scaling of resources means the ability of resources to deal with increasing or decreasing demand.
	* The resources being used by customers at any given point of time are automatically monitored.
* **Measured Service**
	* In this service cloud provider controls and monitors all the aspects of cloud service. Resource optimization, billing, and capacity planning etc. depend on it.
