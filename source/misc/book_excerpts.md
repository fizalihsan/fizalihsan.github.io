# Crucial Conversations

> Author: Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler, Laura Roppe

- Refocus on your motives - When someone completely disagrees with you on a hot issue, instead of losing temper, start by examining your motives. Ask yourself what you really want.
- Do not vehemently defend yourself, save face, avoid embarrassment, win, be right or punish others
- Our motives change when adrenaline kicks in
- Start with your heart - although we are merely bystanders in life’s never ending stream of head on collisions, rarely are we completely innocent.
- Work on yourself first - not only can you improve yourself, you are the only person you can change.
- When people contribute to shared pool, they are committed to act.
- Salute and stay mute - with superiors
- Freeze your lover - with spouse. Giving cold shoulder
