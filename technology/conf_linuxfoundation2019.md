        * monocloud
        * no portability: cloud dependent devops process
        * workflow porability: cloud independent devops process
        * application portability: apps can run on any cloud
        * DR portability: apps can failover to another cloud - gitlab geo?
        * workload portability: apps shift workload b/w multiple clouds dynamically
        * data portability: data changes can happen in multiple clouds (hardest) - Cockroach db does this
